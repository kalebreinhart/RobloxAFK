This repo is for a very simple Roblox automation tool. 

Using this tool, you can AFK in Roblox. 

Your character will simply jump twice at random intervals between 100 and 200 seconds. 

You may change this keystroke if you'd like by diving into the mousekey library for additional key values.

Requires pywin32 and mousekey
