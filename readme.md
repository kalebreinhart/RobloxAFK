This repo is for a very simple Roblox automation tool. 

Using this tool, you can AFK in Roblox. 

Your character will simply jump at random intervals between 100 and 200 seconds. 

You may change this keystroke if you'd like by diving into the mousekey library for additional key values.

Requires pywin32 and mousekey for the python file, or launch pre-compiled binary RblxAFK.exe

!! IMPORTANT !!
If using in an RDP session you have to transfer your session to a console session in order for the game automation to persist after RDP session end.
I have provided a batch script to accomplish this. It needs ran as admin, so I created an elevated shortcut to the script.
